# EthnosDev

_Software development and training for every people group in the world_

![World Map](/img/worldmap.jpg)

The **purpose** of EthnosDev is to glorify God by creating software to meet the spiritual and felt needs of ethnolinguistic groups around the world. This naturally includes people who speak the majority languages of the world but also those who speak minority languages that have traditionally been neglected in the app market. 

Since there is more work than one company can accomplish, EthnosDev **values** collaboration in open-source projects and training local developers to build applications for their own people.
