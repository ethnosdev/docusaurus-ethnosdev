# Products

At EthnosDev, we believe that the Word of God shouldn't be peddled for a profit, so we provide ministry-related software free of charge. However, we also value honest work that provides for our needs so that we won't be dependant on donations. For that, we build language-related software and provide training that customers are willing to pay for.

## Ministry-related software

The following are categories of apps that we are currently building or are interested in building, especially for people groups that lack them:

- Worship lyrics and songs
- Bibles
- Bible study materials
- Devotionals
- Stories

If you have the rights to the content and would like to make it freely available in app form, feel free to contact us.

## Language-related software

The following are for-profit app categories that we are interested in pursuing, especially for minority or endangered languages:

- Dictionaries
- Language training
- Language study tools

If you have a language that you would like to see more app resources for, let us know. 

## Training

If you would like to learn how to build your own ministry or language related software, especially for a minority or endangered ethnolinguistic group, you're also welcome to reach out.
